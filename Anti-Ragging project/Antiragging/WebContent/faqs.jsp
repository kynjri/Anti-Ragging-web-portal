<h4><b> Q: What is ragging? </b></h4>
<p>1. Any disorderly conduct whether by words spoken or written or by an act which has the effect of teasing, treating or handling with rudeness a fresher or a junior student.</p>
<p>2. Indulging in a rowdy or undisciplined activities which causes or is likely to cause annoyance, hardship or psychological harm or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in a fresher or a junior student.</p>
<p>3. Asking the students to do any act or perform something which such student will not do in the ordinary course and which has the effect of causing or generating a sense of shame or embarrassment so as
 to adversely affect the physique or psyche of a fresher or a junior student.</p>
 <h4> <b>Q: Why would anyone indulge in ragging? </b></h4>
 <p>1. To derive a sadistic pleasure.</p>
<p>2. To show off power, authority or superiority over juniors or freshers. </p>
<h4> <b>Q: Is some form of ragging good? </b></h4>
<p> No. Ragging, in any form, is a reprehensible act which does no good to anyone.</p>
<p> Every act of ragging, major or minor, is beyond the limits of decency, morality and humanity.</p>
<p>Civilised societies across the world are doing away with this nefarious practice.</p>
<h4><b> Q: Why does ragging still exist? </b></h4>
<p>1. Earlier, public opinion against ragging was not as strong as it is now.</p>
<p>2. It was not clearly defined what ragging is.</p>
<p>3. Earlier, the concern was limited to violent form of ragging and other forms were considered tolerable, even desirable. This is not the case now. </p>
<h4><b>Q: What is zero tolerance policy? </b></h4>
<p>No act of ragging, major or minor, shall go unnoticed. No ragger, male or female, student or non-student, shall go unpunished. No institution
 that fails to take action against ragging shall be allowed to operate. </p>
<h4><b>Q: Who will implement this policy?</b> </h4>
<p>Everyone concerned, specially:</p>
<p>1. The heads of the educational institutions.</p>
<p>2. The State Government, through Divisional Commissioners.</p>
<p>3. The opinion makers. </p>
<h4><b>Q: How can we exterminate this evil practice?</b> </h4>
<p> By exercise of the disciplinary authority of the teachers over the students and of the management of the institutions over the teachers and students.</p>
<p>No effort should be made to minimize the number of reported cases. Reporting is to be encouraged through all available means.</p>
<p>Anti-ragging movement should be initiated by the institutions right from the time of advertisement for admissions. 
<p>The prospectus, the form for admission and/or any other literature issued to the aspirants for admission must clearly mention that ragging is banned in the
 institution and anyone indulging in ragging is likely to receive deterrent punishment.</p>
